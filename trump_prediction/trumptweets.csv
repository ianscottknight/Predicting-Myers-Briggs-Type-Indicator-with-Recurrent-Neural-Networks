Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
"I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!"

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
"Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world."
"Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety."
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
"Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country."

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

"Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference"
"Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time."
"Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!"

I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
"How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!"
"The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me"
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
"The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!"
"The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!"
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
"Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out"
"If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild"
"The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!"
"I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!"
"Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)"
"Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
"Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!"
"Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!"
"Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT"

"If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!"
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
"With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?"

"The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!"
"In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!"
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures."""
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"

"On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
"Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!"
"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!"
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him

"Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking,  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore."
"""@Vanderpunked: Can we drop @realDonaldTrump off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done?"" I would fix it fast!"
"The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters ""space to destroy"" - another real genius!"
"Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?"
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.
Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
"Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places"
"Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!"
"As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!"
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
Fact â€“ Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

"Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so. I never went bankrupt..."
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
"For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals."
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
"... Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!"
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.

Which team is your favorite?
"Re Omarosa: Nasty, tough or smart...or all?"
"Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?"
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.
That's an interesting talent that Marilu possesses!
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
"On the whole, the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet."
Gary as the Cat in the Hat? He can work it out.
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n?
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.

IMO--- Manti Teâ€™o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
Can it just be new age that Manti Teâ€™o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
Not believable that Manti Teâ€™o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....
...or mentally troubled (or a con).

"Just saw my new line of shirts, ties & suits @Macys -- they are fantastic! Would make great holiday presents!"
Last season the Apprentice was the #1 show on television on Sunday night from 10 to 11--this season's show is even better!
"We just passed 1.9M followers & gained over 250,000 followers in the last month.Thank you--let's have fun and do business."
"@DaveGardiner7 @DuncanBannatyne  Thanks, & I love the people of Aberdeen."
@BOARDRISKMAN  Thanks!
Tourism is booming because of it. RT @DuncanBannatyne Just been to the fantastic @realDonaldTrump golf links in Aberdeen. Quality stuff
"According to UK newspapers, no wind turbines have been ordered for many months in Britain--an obsolete technology that ruins communities!"
"When someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more. This has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life!"
"I am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects. Whenever I tweet, some call it a tirade..totally dishonest!"
Trump International Golf Links was just rated one of the greatest courses in the world. Virtually all reviews are saying the same thing.Â 
The people of Scotland love Trump International Golf Links.
Aberdeen tourism is booming because of my great Scottish golf club.Â 
"Many political pundits are using the term ""Art of the Deal"".... they should thank me. That is my term and book title."

Thanks- many are saying I'm the best 140 character writer in the world. It's easy when it's fun.
I love Twitter.... it's like owning your own newspaper--- without the losses.
"I'm a skeptical guy, but I don't believe Petraeus used this to get out of the Benghazi hearings."
"Wow, Â I never saw the Petraeus thing coming. A straight laced guy! Very sad for him and his family."
"I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport, a terrible situation!"
Everybody wants me to talk about Robert Pattinson and not Brian Williamsâ€”I guess people just donâ€™t care about Brian!
Sheâ€™s baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it wonâ€™t help-- sheâ€™s got no talent & no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
"Price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallon--welcome to the new world."
Itâ€™s hard to believe that we are rationing gas in NYC. OPEC is laughing all the way to the bank.
".@cyndilauper Condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes."
.@antbaxter Only the stupid @BBC would air your garbageâ€”no wonder they are in such deep trouble.
.@antbaxter  Anthonyâ€”did you illegally take clips from the Letterman @Late_Show show and @GolfChannel without their approval?
.@antbaxter  I predict somebody is going to sue you!
".@antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeenâ€”sales are thru the roof & Aberdeen seeing big benefits."
".@antbaxterâ€”Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to makeâ€”where did you get that kind of money?"
.@antbaxterâ€”Your documentary works better than any sleeping pillâ€”in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
Why do so many people say I hate President Obamaâ€”I donâ€™t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!
@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxterâ€”Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world. Your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop.
9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last & yet the Republicans lostâ€”do you think they might be doing something wrong!
I got to know @johnboehner very wellâ€”he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country!
I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help.
Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...I hope!
The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
"Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention."
"Remember to watch the series finale of ""The Men Who Built America"" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History"
Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio & he would be President.
"Remember to watch the series finale of ""The Men Who Built America"" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History"
China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine http://reut.rs/Sx7nJnÂ   They will end up stealing the design from us as usual.
"China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes http://reut.rs/Sx64doÂ   They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won't do anything."
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon.
"At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better!"
"With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal."
.@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi.
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off.
Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again http://bit.ly/Sx3xQkÂ  Thanks for letting us know now
"I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?!"
I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
It is that time of the year.  The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.  The greatest ice rink in the country.
"Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night, I was on last Thursday"
...I  trounced him in ratings & Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday. Brianâ€”are you irrelevant?
Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused.
A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).

"Now that the election is over, watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China--my prediction."
It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.  We will fight on!
Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.
The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObamaâ€™s second term.
"Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost. What a waste of money."
Millions without electricity across NY & NJ. The media has covered for Obamaâ€™s massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
"Pervert alert.  @RepWeiner is back on twitter. All girls under the age of 18, block him immediately."
"Amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements--- but media doesn't care about... http://fb.me/21wG9mgPIÂ "
It's freezing and snowing in New York--we need global warming!
We have to make America great again!
Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together!
Another four years--not good for the country but we'll have to live with it!
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow.
"Brian, if I'm ""well past the last exit to relevance"" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews"
Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. People will learn the truth! @NBCNightlyNews
"Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news."
"Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @NBCNightlyNews"
The voting booth process was a total disasterâ€”it could and should be much better and more efficientâ€”tremendous room for error!
This was the Republicans election to win. @MittRomney is a good man but he just never connected with the people.
.@bwilliams--wouldn't you love to have my ratings?
The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratingsâ€”a disaster!
.@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.
Trump volunteers were out early today to offload cases of food and supplies for hard-hit Rockaways residents #Sandy
Iâ€™ve sent a 10-wheeler filled with 358 master cases of food and supplies to my hometown of Queens today #TrumpCares
P.S. 42 in Queens is getting a truckload of food and much needed supplies for Rockaway residents #HurricaneSandyRelief
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up!
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Our nation is a once great nation divided!
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble...like never before.
This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!
Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us.
We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!
"Well, back to the drawing board!"

@Tappersong  Thanks Gary.
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't.
Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 http://bit.ly/YSdzQyÂ  What took @CBS so long to release this footage?
"If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately."
Now Chinese state run companies are taking over our coal market http://on.wsj.com/YScqIKÂ   China wants to deplete our resources here at home.
Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy.  Wrong!

In the 1950â€™s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years.
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.

Tune in for #TrumpTuesday on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow morning.
Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.  Donâ€™t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.  Kick him out of office tomorrow.
The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy. How would the press cover this if a Republican was President.
China is worried. The polls are trending for @MittRomney. They wonâ€™t be able to steal from us anymore.
".@ABFAlecBaldwin  P.S. Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC--and he stated he ""adores you."""

How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public!
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!

@stass13 Thanks!
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
"President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!"
"President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good!"
Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.

A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obamaâ€™s lack of transparency. I don't blame them.
"There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obamaâ€™s choice, once he releases all of his records."

The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding?

Chinaâ€™s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses http://bloom.bg/V4SZxjÂ  Their market gains the day we are hit by storm
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years?
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://fb.me/1EctZPju0Â 
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!

The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 â€“ and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher.
Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House.
@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad.
"My interview with @gretawire last night -- ""Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'""  http://fxn.ws/omLgMcÂ "
We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it.

China's business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.
The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now.
ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses.
"If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences."
If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?
Crude is at $85 right now â€“ isnâ€™t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.
@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution.
"Iran admits to aiding the Libyan ""Rebels"" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn? http://bit.ly/paSPy1Â "

America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People.
"China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership, it can be stopped."
@BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion.
"There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance, a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election."
We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation. What are we getting back?
"Just as I predicted, @Joe_Biden was a complete disaster in China. He condoned the Chinese one-child policy anâ€_ (cont) http://deck.ly/~sjaylÂ "

Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over.
We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil?
@RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration. Wrong for media to ignore him.

"While @BarackObama continues to defend ObamaCare in the courts, he is also granting companies waivers. Eveâ€_ (cont) http://deck.ly/~42zLdÂ "
Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens.
@BarackObama is sure a master delegator.Â He has sent @Joe_Biden to China.Â The Chinese are laughing at us. We MUST do better.
@BarackObamaâ€™s new job plan will certainly do the following â€“ 1. Not create any jobs. 2. Borrow more money from China.Â

@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.  Nice work ethic.
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up.
"Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America."
"Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy."
Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate?
Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader.

Your questions about my desk answered in today's #trumpvlog... http://bit.ly/pl9wDPÂ 
Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.
Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong.
This is the best deal the Republicans could get?
Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake.
Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure.
We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem.
No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America.
Watched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy.
"If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses  -- ""Watch the fine details in every deal"" -- The Art of the Deal"
Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? Bad idea.

The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama.... http://bit.ly/qjI442Â  #trumpvlog
The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly.
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline.
Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things

"""China is our enemy--they want to destroy us"" -- Redstate Interview"
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
"While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President."
"@johnboehner  @EricCantor  ""You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on."" - The Art of the Deal"
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
